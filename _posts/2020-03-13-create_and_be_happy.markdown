Iâ€™ve always fancied myself a creative. Though, at this point in my life, I might call myself a repressed artist. I studied Political Science (as well as economics and French) in undergrad. I felt inspired and thought I might enjoy learning about and practicing law, so I went to law school. After graduating from law school, on my journey through that profession as a paralegal, it became apparent that being a practicing attorney was no longer my passion. Over the past year I have studied Python and now Ruby. I chose the software engineering path as I would love to try my hand at creating again. I enjoy seeing projects through from beginning to end and look forward to learning so much more.
